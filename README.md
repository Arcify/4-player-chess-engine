# chess-engine (in progress)
Compact hash-table based implementation of four-player-chess using pygame

Modules needed:

* pygame

### IMPORTANT

**The images needed to display the pieces can be found in the respository and have to be placed in the same folder as chess_engine.py**

TODO/CONTRIBUTING:

* Implement more ways to avoid a check in the in_check() function (e.g. capturing the checking piece)

* Implement the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm

* Implement a neural network to create position tables

* More work needs to be done to improve the overall time-complexity of the chess engine

* Many UI improvements
