# chess-engine
Compact hash-table based implementation of four-player-chess using pygame

Modules needed:

pygame

The fimages needed to display the pieces can be found in the respository and have to be placed in the same folder

This project has only been partially finished. Future improvements that will be made are:

1. Looking for checks more efficient

2. Making the computer player implement Alpha-Beta pruning, Monte Carlo tree search and a neural network based approach

3. Many UI improvements
