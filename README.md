# chess-engine
Compact hash-table based implementation of four-player-chess using pygame

Modules needed:

* pygame

### IMPORTANT

**The images needed to display the pieces can be found in the respository and have to be placed in the same folder as chess_engine.py**

This project has only been partially finished. Future improvements that will be made are:

* Fixing errors in in_check()

* Making the computer player implement Monte Carlo tree search and a convolutional neural network based approach

* Many UI improvements

* Test
